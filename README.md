# IE510-Applied-Nonlinear-Programming

This repo contains files from IE510 Applied Nonlinear Programming at UIUC in Spring 2018 including lecture notes, homeworks and project.

Following topics are covered:

* Unconstrained optimization: optimality conditions, gradient methods, Newtonâ€™s method
* Constrained optimization: necessary and sufficient conditions, conditional gradient method, gradient projection methods.
* Lagrangian Multiplier Theory: KKT conditions, Equality/Inequality Constrained Problems, linearly constrained problems, duality theory
* Penalty method, method of multipliers, barrier method, augmented Lagrangian method
* linear system of equations and conjugate gradient methods, proximal gradient method, ADMM (alternating direction method of multipliers), accelerated methods, neural networks, matrix/tensor decomposition

Hope it helps!
